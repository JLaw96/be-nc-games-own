## Environment variables 

Once you have cloned this repository please note you will not have access to the necessary enviroment variables. In order to successfully connect to the databases locally, you will need to create two .env files. The two files are as follows: .env.test and .env.development. Within  each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment. In order to obtain the correct name for the database, see /db/setup.sql. Remember to specify that one of the databases is for test purposes in the your environment variables like so PGDATABASE=<my_database_test>. Finally, you will need to make sure that these two files have been gitignored.
